# Video-Library
Stores video names in a .txt file and displays them, useful to quickly find if you have a file/video already saved or not. 
Not responsible for any harmful or destruction it may cause (even though it should not) 
code is viewable! 
Thanks to everyone on the discord chat whom helped create this mini program!
